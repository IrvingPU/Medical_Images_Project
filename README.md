### Medical Images Final Project â€” Irving Perez Uribe

## Introduction

This project addresses two key objectives in medical image analysis:

DICOM Image Loading and Visualization:
Loading CT scans, rearranging slices, and generating rotating Maximum Intensity Projections (MIP) for tumor visualization.

3D Tumor Segmentation:
Semi-automatic segmentation of liver tumors based on bounding box and centroid extraction, including visual and numerical evaluation.

The dataset corresponds to Sample 1720 of the RadCTTACEomics collection.
